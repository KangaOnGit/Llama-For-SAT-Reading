Silas was a weaver and a\n","notorious miser, but then the gold he had hoarded was\n","stolen. Shortly after, Silas adopted a young child, Eppie, the\n","daughter of an impoverished woman who had died\n","suddenly.\n","\n","    Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must\n","be worshipped in close-locked solitude—which was\n","hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song\n","of birds, and started to no human tones—Eppie was a\n","creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires,\n","seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and\n","living movements; making trial of everything, with\n","trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in\n","all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his\n","thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to\n","nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object\n","compacted of changes and hopes that forced his\n","thoughts onward, and carried them far away from\n","their old eager pacing towards the same blank\n","limit—carried them away to the new things that\n","would come with the coming years, when Eppie\n","would have learned to understand how her father\n","Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of\n","that time in the ties and charities that bound together\n","the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that\n","he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened\n","and blinded more and more to all things except the\n","monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web;\n","but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and\n","made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening\n","his senses with her fresh life, even to the old\n","winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early\n","spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because\n","she had joy.\n","    And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting,\n","so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows,\n","Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the\n","late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening\n","under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered\n","head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where\n","the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank\n","where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to\n","pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged\n","things that murmured happily above the bright\n","petals, calling “Dad-dad’s” attention continually by\n","bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her\n","ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to\n","please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that\n","they might listen for the note to come again: so that\n","when it came, she set up her small back and laughed\n","with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this\n","way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs\n","again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline\n","and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of\n","crowding remembrances from which he turned away\n","timidly, taking refuge in Eppie’s little world, that lay\n","lightly on his enfeebled spirit.\n","    As the child’s mind was growing into knowledge,\n","his mind was growing into memory: as her life\n","unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow\n","prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually\n","into full consciousness.\n","    It was an influence which must gather force with\n","every new year: the tones that stirred Silas’ heart\n","grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers;\n","shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie’s eyes and\n","ears, and there was more that “Dad-dad” was\n","imperatively required to notice and account for.\n","Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she\n","developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for\n","devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which\n","found much exercise, not only for Silas’ patience, but\n","for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor\n","Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible\n","demands of love.\n","\n","\n","\n","Question 3:\n","Which statement best describes a technique the narrator uses to represent Silas’s character before he adopted Eppie?\n","A) The narrator emphasizes Silas’s former obsession with wealth by depicting his gold as requiring certain behaviors on his part.\n","B) The narrator underscores Silas’s former greed by describing his gold as seeming to reproduce on its own.\n","C) The narrator hints at Silas’s former antisocial attitude by contrasting his present behavior toward his neighbors with his past behavior toward them.\n","D) The narrator demonstrates Silas’s former lack of self-awareness by implying that he is unable to recall life before Eppie.\n","\n","Answer:\n"]}],"source":["print(data[\"train\"]['text'][0])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"_0UKWAUSMAsH","outputId":"19d09ee9-83ae-4c73-d2f5-49fb0dadd416"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["A\n"]}],"source":["print(data[\"train\"][\"answer\"][0])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"TlyHKF-QdtSL"},"outputs":[],"source":["import re\n","\n","def extract_sections(text):\n","    \"\"\"Parse raw SAT text into structured sections\"\"\"\n","    sections = {\n","        'passage': '',\n","        'question': '',\n","        'choices': [],\n","        'answer_letter': ''\n","    }\n","\n","    #

After her travels\n","with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education\n","by attending Barnard College in New York City. She\n","told us all that at school the first day. When my little\n","brother Ralphord asked what did she study at\n","Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that\n","Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the\n","sister school of Columbia University, of which, she\n","expected, we all had heard.\n","    It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to\n","find her true mission in life, that she wandered one\n","afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey,\n","who was talking about his famous book, Democracy\n","and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies\n","by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat\n","with students after a lecture—especially female\n","students, she added—sometimes over coffee, and see\n","in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was\n","after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss\n","Spivey had marched to the Teacher’s College and\n","signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a\n","cheery blue-suited woman from the WPA1 that she\n","wanted to bring democracy and education to the\n","poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner\n","of America.\n","    They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.\n","    Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding\n","my brother Ralphord’s eye.\n","    What we really wanted to know about—all\n","twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one\n","room—was the pearly white button hanging on a\n","string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher’s\n","desk up front. That button on a string was something\n","new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh\n","grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss\n","Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment,\n","the whole world—or at least a wrinkled map of\n","it—unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss\n","Chandler, had never once made use of that map,\n","which was older than our fathers, and until that\n","moment, not a one of us knew it was there.\n","    Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and\n","Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean\n","and past the Rock of Gibraltar into the\n","Mediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she\n","gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and\n","Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa.\n","They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she\n","said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in\n","every crack and crevice.\n","    “And can you guess what we saw from the train?”\n","Miss Spivey asked. We could not. “Camels!” she said.\n","“We saw a whole caravan of camels.” She looked\n","around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and\n","delighted at the thought.\n","    We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard,\n","until Mavis Davis spoke up.\n","    “She means like the three kings rode to\n","Bethlehem,” Mavis said, and she folded her hands\n","smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the\n","room.\n","    Miss Spivey made a mistake right then.

She stepped off the train wearing a\n","pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navy\n","Line blue dress, and a little white tam that rode the waves\n","of her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was\n","a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia,\n","although it was nothing, she said, compared to the\n","119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one\n","time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real\n","place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of\n","the people gathered to welcome her on the burned\n","grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating\n","through their shorts, they don’t like to hear that this\n","is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or\n","not, the majority of those present were inclined to see\n","the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive\n","light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like\n","my momma said, “We weren’t no poorer than we’d\n","ever been,” and the citizens of Threestep were in the\n","mood for a little excitement.\n","   Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to\n","give it to them.

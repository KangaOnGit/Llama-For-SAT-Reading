Two years later, she told a\n","cheery blue-suited woman from the WPA1 that she\n","wanted to bring democracy and education to the\n","poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner\n","of America.\n","    They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.\n","    Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding\n","my brother Ralphord’s eye.\n","    What we really wanted to know about—all\n","twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one\n","room—was the pearly white button hanging on a\n","string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher’s\n","desk up front. That button on a string was something\n","new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh\n","grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss\n","Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment,\n","the whole world—or at least a wrinkled map of\n","it—unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss\n","Chandler, had never once made use of that map,\n","which was older than our fathers, and until that\n","moment, not a one of us knew it was there.\n","    Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and\n","Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean\n","and past the Rock of Gibraltar into the\n","Mediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she\n","gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and\n","Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa.\n","They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she\n","said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in\n","every crack and crevice.\n","    “And can you guess what we saw from the train?”\n","Miss Spivey asked. We could not. “Camels!” she said.\n","“We saw a whole caravan of camels.” She looked\n","around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and\n","delighted at the thought.\n","    We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard,\n","until Mavis Davis spoke up.\n","    “She means like the three kings rode to\n","Bethlehem,” Mavis said, and she folded her hands\n","smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the\n","room.\n","    Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of\n","beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory\n","smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed\n","on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss\n","Spivey simply said, “That’s right.”\n","\n","### Question:\n","In the passage, Threestep is mainly presented as a\n","\n","### Choices:\n","A) summer retreat for vacationers.\n","B) small rural town.\n","C) town that is home to a prominent university.\n","D) comfortable suburb.\n","\n","Respond with ONLY the letter and full text of the correct answer.assistant\n","\n","B) small rural town.\n","\n","=== Final Result ===\n","[Model Prediction]\n","B) small rural town.\n","\n","[Ground Truth]\n","B) small rural town.\n"]}],"source":["test_sample_idx = 4\n","input_text = data[\"test\"]['text'][test_sample_idx]\n","true_answer = data[\"test\"]['answer'][test_sample_idx]\n","\n","predicted_answer = predict(input_text)\n","\n","true_answer_full = map_answer(input_text, true_answer)\n","\n","print(\"\\n=== Final Result ===\")\n","print(f\"[Model Prediction]\\n{predicted_answer}\")\n","print(f\"\\n[Ground Truth]\\n{true_answer_full}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FHAv8F09P3xR"},"source":["## **5.
